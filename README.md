# Developing with Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter is an application that provides a simple, flexible and very popular code development environment. Walk through the [notes/jupyter_notebook.md](notes/jupyter_notebook.md) file to get Jupyter set up and to learn the basics of using the interface. At the end of this process you will launch jupyter locally and interactively run the notebook [`notebooks/Intro_to_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb`](notebooks/Intro_to_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb) which will introduce you to the key commands for the notebook development environment.
